Group Work Reflection

Last week proved to be a valuable opportunity to gain insight on my strengths
and weaknesses while working with a team on a collaborative project. It was a learning experience
that proved that concrete planning, be it pseudo-coding or otherwise, as a group is an invaluable
step in the process. Many pitfalls of our project could have been avoided and we could have spent our
time more meaningfully had we mapped out the steps we wanted to take towards goals we wanted to achieve.

Personally, I found that I had less of an eye for CSS than my peers but that I was more proficient in
the functionally aspects found in Javascript and could affectively delegate portions of the work that
lent to my peers' strengths.

Keeping morale at times was challenging as we navigated our first collaborative project but
overall I believe that we maintained a steady pace given our capabilities, and that future
projects will only go more smoothly as they're executed and we become more experienced.
