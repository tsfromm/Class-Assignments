                One: When I first brought my cat home from the Humane Society she was a mangy, 
                pitiful animal. She was so thin that you could count her vertebrae just by 
                looking at her. Apparently she was declawed by her previous owners, then 
                abandoned or lost. Since she couldn't hunt, she nearly starved. Not only that, 
                but she had an abscess on one hip. The vets at the Humane Society had drained it, 
                but it was still scabby and without fur. She had a terrible cold, too. She was 
                sneezing and sniffling and her meow was just a hoarse squeak. And she'd lost 
                half her tail somewhere. Instead of tapering gracefully, it had a bony knob at the end.
